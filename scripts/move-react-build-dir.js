/**
 * Developer note:
 *
 * The ultimate goal of this script is to enable the ability to import the React components
 * with the following syntax:
 *
 *     import { ComponentName } from "@vscode/webview-ui-toolkit/react";
 *
 * Without this script, the import statement would instead look like so (note the `dist`):
 *
 *     import { ComponentName } from "@vscode/webview-ui-toolkit/dist/react";
 *
 * This import syntax is accomplished by simply moving the already built react directory
 * out of the dist directory into the project root and then updating some of the import
 * paths in the React build files to reflect this new location. This react folder is
 * intentionally not included in .npmignore so it will be published in the root directory
 * of the toolkit package.
 *
 * It's important to note that this script is somewhat brittle because it relies on some
 * assumptions about what the import paths in the React build files look like to begin
 * with (reference the regex strings in the updateReactBuildImportPaths function). If
 * anything about the starting import paths change it will likely break this script.
 *
 * This is an intentional trade off for implementation simplicity, a light sense of confidence
 * that these import paths probably won't change soon, and the fact that this script is supposed
 * to be temporary.
 *
 * Eventually this script should be replaced with TypeScript support for package exports
 * (https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/33079). It was supposed to arrive in TS v4.5,
 * but was pushed back due to stability concerns. When those changes land, the toolkit should be
 * updated to the appropriate version of TS and start using the `exports` field in package.json.
 *
 * Until that time, this script will achieve the same results in import syntax.
