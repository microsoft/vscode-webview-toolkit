## About this toolkit

This Figma toolkit is an extension of the VS Code Toolkit and made specifically for designing webviews for VS Code extensions. The VS Code Toolkit has all of the core components and templates needed for creating experiences that take place in the explorer, command palette, terminal, editor, and debugger. The experiences in webviews often have design requirements that go beyond the base experiences in VS Code. This toolkit was created to give people the tools to designs webview experiences that are consistent with the rest of VS Code. All of the components were designed with theming in mind and use colors that map directly to the VS Code dark theme color tokens. The components in the toolkit are based on the Fluent Web components but have been redesigned to match VS Code's visual language.

### 4. Install Icon Fonts

Install the Codicon and Seti icon fonts to use the glyphs. Make sure you reload your Figma file after you‚Äôve installed the fonts:

### 5. Using Components

You can now search for components using the ‚ÄúAssets‚Äù panel or you can go to the master library and copy components and paste them into your file.

Ensure that when you paste components that they are instances:

### 6. Swapping states

Most components will have various states that you can swap to, which should retain their overrides:

### 7. Using icons

Use the ‚ÄúVisual Studio Code Icons‚Äù Figma plugin to copy icon glyphs:

### 8. Icon styles

All icons can be replaced by pasting a glyph. Ensure that you use the correct icon style for either Codicons or Seti icons.

Seti icons have color styles that you can also use.

### 9. Color mapping

The last page in the Figma file has the Color Palette, which contains all the colors used in the default dark and light themes. The color tokens are broken up into sections based on their use in VS Code. Here's an example of the button category, which includes the background, foreground, and hoverBackground. Each card also includes the HEX value.

When looking at the color library in the toolkit, each color is marked with the theme it belongs to, the category, and it's use.

When viewing toolkit components in the "Code" view, you will see the color tokens used.
