# Visual Studio Code Webview Toolkit

Welcome to the VS Code Webview Toolkit Storybook! ðŸ‘‹

The [VS Code Webview Toolkit](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-webview-toolkit) is a component library made for building webview-based extensions in VS Code that match the native look and behavior of VS Code itself. Features of the library include:

-   **Implements The VS Code Design Language:** All components implement the VS Code design language, enabling developers to create extensions that have a consistent look and feel with the rest of VS Code.
-   **Theming As A First Class Citizen:** All components were designed with theming in mind and the toolkit ships with utilities that automatically consume and apply VS Code color theme changes.
-   **Plays Nice With Your Tech Stack:** The library is built with web components meaning you will be able use the components no matter what tech stack (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) you use.
-   **Accessible Out Of The Box:** All components ship with web standard compliant ARIA labels and keyboard navigation.
