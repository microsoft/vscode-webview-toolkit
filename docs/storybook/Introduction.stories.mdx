# Webview UI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code

Welcome to the Webview UI Toolkit Storybook! ðŸ‘‹

Features of the library include:

-   **Implements the Visual Studio Code design language:** All components follow the design language of Visual Studio Code â€“ enabling developers to create extensions that have a consistent look and feel with the rest of the editor.
-   **Automatic support for color themes:** All components are designed with theming in mind and will automatically display the current editor theme.
-   **Use any tech stack:** The library ships as a set of web components, meaning developers can use the toolkit no matter what tech stack (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) their extension is built with.
-   **Accessible out of the box:** All components ship with web standard compliant ARIA labels and keyboard navigation.
