# Visual Studio Code Webview Toolkit

Welcome to the [VS Code Webview Toolkit](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-webview-toolkit).

This toolkit is an implementation of the [VS Code Webview Figma Toolkit](https://www.figma.com/file/KO1yufOeApPEMymIxJ3dTf/VS-Code-Webview-Toolkit?node-id=0%3A1)
and made specifically for building webview-based extensions in VS Code.

The VS Code Webview Toolkit has all of the core components needed for creating webview-based
extensions that take place in the explorer, command palette, terminal, editor, and debugger.
The experiences in webviews often have design requirements that go beyond the base experiences
in VS Code.

This toolkit was created to give people the tools to build webview experiences that are consistent
with the rest of VS Code. All of the components were designed with theming in mind and use colors
that map directly to the VS Code dark theme color tokens. The components in the toolkit are based
on the Fluent Web components but have been redesigned to match VS Code's visual language.
